A simple To Do progressive web app using HTML, CSS and JS
<br>
A progressive web app (PWA) is a website that looks and behaves as if it is a mobile app. PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally.

This is just a To Do app in which you can make a note of things to do. Made for people like me who forgets things XD
